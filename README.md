# Railway-Reservation-System
The Railway Reservation System is basically a database based project done with the help of Python Language. This Project is very useful for the people to book or cancel train tickets by sitting at home with one cell phone in their hand. This project can be modified for various reservations.
A Railway Reservation System, built using Python for the core logic and SQL for the database management. I have used a relational database and list stack implementation (LiFo) in my project. The project is inspired by  Indian Railways, IRCTC, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, and RailYatri.in
